<Section type="about">

The CLI helps you manage your SST apps.

```bash title="Install"
curl -fsSL https://ion.sst.dev/install | bash
```

:::note
The CLI currently supports macOS, Linux, and WSL. Windows support is coming soon.
:::

Once installed you can run the commands using.

```bash
sst [command]
```

The CLI takes a few global flags. For example, the deploy command takes the `--stage` flag

```bash
sst deploy --stage=production
```

</Section>

---

## Global Flags

### stage
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">string</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>

The stage the CLI is running on.

```bash frame="none"
sst [command] --stage=production
```

If the stage is not passed in, then the CLI will:

1. Uses the username on the local machine.
   - If the username is `root`, `admin`, `prod`, `dev`, `production`, then it will prompt for a stage name.
2. Stores this in the `.sst/stage` file and reads from it in the future.

:::tip
The stage that is stored in the `.sst/stage` file is called your local stage.

</Segment>

### verbose
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">boolean</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>

Enables verbose logging for the CLI output.

```bash frame="none"
sst [command] --verbose
```

</Segment>

### help
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">boolean</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>

Prints help for the given command.

```sh frame="none"
sst [command] --help
```

Or for the global help.

```sh frame="none"
sst --help
```

</Segment>

## Commands

### version
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst version
```
</Section>
Prints the current version of the CLI.
</Segment>

### dev
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst dev [command]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">command?</code></p>
The command to run
</Section>

Run your app in development mode. Optionally, pass in a command to start your frontend as well.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev
```

This starts a local server, watch for changes to your code, updates your app, and it runs your functions [Live](/docs/live).

:::note
If your run `sst dev` with a command, it'll not print your your function logs.
:::

If you start your frontend along with `sst dev`, it'll [link your resources](/docs/linking) to it too.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev next dev
```

Starting two instances of `sst dev` in the same project only starts a single _server_. Meaning that the second instance connects to the existing one.

:::note
You can start as many instances of `sst dev` in your app as you want.
:::

This means that you don't need to run `sst dev` separately for your frontend, unlike with SST v2.

:::tip
You don't need to run `sst dev` separately for your frontend, unlike with SST v2.
:::

However, if you are working on your backend functions and your frontend at the same time, you can run `sst dev` to view your functions logs.

### secret
<Segment>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Subcommands
- <p>[<code class="key">set</code>](#secret-set)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">list</code>](#secret-list)</p>
</Section>
Manage the secrets in your app defined with `sst.Secret`.
</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-set" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">set</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret set <name> <value>
```
</Section>
<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">name</code></p>
The name of the secret.
- <p><code class="key">value</code></p>
The value of the secret.
</Section>

Set the value of the secret.

For example, set the `sst.Secret` called `StripeSecret` to `123456789`.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set StripeSecret 123456789
```

Optionally, set the secret in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set StripeSecret productionsecret --stage=production
```

</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-list" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">list</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret list
```
</Section>

Lists all the secrets.

Optionally, list the secrets in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret list --stage=production
```

</Segment>

### shell
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst shell [command]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">command?</code></p>
A command to run.
</Section>

Run a command with all the resources linked to the environment.

For example, you can run a node script and use the [Node client](/docs/reference/client) to access *all* the linked resources in your app.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const myMainBucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyMainBucket");
const myAdminBucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyAdminBucket");

new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyMainWeb", {
  link: [myMainBucket]
});

new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyAdminWeb", {
  link: [myAdminBucket]
});
```

Now if you run a script.

```bash frame="none"
sst shell node my-script.js
```

It'll have access to all the buckets from above.

```js title="my-script.js"
import { Resource } from "sst";

console.log(Resource.MyMainBucket.name, Resource.MyAdminBucket.name);
```

If no command is passed in, it opens a shell session with the linked resources.

```bash frame="none"
sst shell
```

This is useful if you want to run multiple commands, all while accessing the linked resources.

</Segment>

### install
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst install
```
</Section>

Installs the dependencies in `sst.config.ts`.

You'll need to run this when you add a new provider to your config.

</Segment>

### deploy
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst deploy
```
</Section>

Deploy your application. By default, it deploys to your local stage.

Optionally, deploy your app to a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst deploy --stage=production
```

</Segment>

### remove
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst remove
```
</Section>

Removes your application. By default, it removes your local stage.

:::tip
The resources in your app are removed based on the `removalPolicy` in your `sst.config.ts`.
:::

Optionally, remove your app from a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst deploy --stage=production
```

</Segment>

### cancel
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst cancel
```
</Section>

If something unexpected kills the `sst deploy` process, your local state file might be left in an unreadable state.

This will prevent you froom deploying again. You can run `sst cancel` to clean up the state file and be able to deploy again.

You should not usually run into this.

</Segment>

### init
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst init
```
</Section>

Run this to initialize your app in drop-in mode. Currently, supports Next.js apps.

This will create a `sst.config.ts` file and configure the types for your project.
